# MultipleChoice
I am a computer science student. What if I program something to help me study? 
I orrginally made this when I was in first year as an interactive challenge to study for my midterms and finals.
Many years later after Rebooting WECS (Women in Engineering and Computer Sciecne Club), I was helpign out a student in a review session for the same class and I told them about these "fun" ways that I could study. I wanted to share it so that people could change it,modify and learn so here it is :)
